\#Python Developer Assessment



This repository is for my developer assessment tasks.





**TASKS COMPLETED.**



**1.Task1.2 -GIT BASICS :**



&nbsp;	\* Learned Git workflow: commits, branching, merging, and resolving conflicts.



&nbsp;       \* Practiced creating branches for each task and merging them into main.







**2. Task 1.3 – CODE STYLE :**



&nbsp;	\*Ensured all Python code follows PEP8 standards.



&nbsp;	\*Fixed formatting issues like spacing, indentation, and naming conventions.



**Relevant files:**



&nbsp;	\*bad\_style.py – Original code with style issues.







**3. Task 2.1 – DSA CHALLENGES :** 

&nbsp;	\*Solved Python problems involving data structures and algorithms.



&nbsp;	\*Practiced writing clean and efficient code.



**Relevant files:**



&nbsp;	\*dsa\_challenges.py







**4. Task 2.2 – OOP IMPLEMENTATION :**



&nbsp;	\*Implemented Object-Oriented Programming in Python.



&nbsp;	\*Created the Book class with methods for summary and age calculation.



**Relevant files:**



&nbsp;	\*book\_store.py







**5. Task 2.3 – ERROR HANDLING AND DEBUGGING :**



&nbsp;	\*Practiced debugging techniques and handling exceptions.



&nbsp;	\*Added try-except blocks for safer code execution.



**Relevant files:**



\*debug\_errors.py









**6. Task 3.1 – API INTERACTION :** 



&nbsp;	\*Fetched data from **JSON Placeholder API** using the requests library.



&nbsp;	\*Parsed JSON response and displayed user information (name, email, city).



**Relevant files:**



&nbsp;	\*api\_client.py









**## Reflections**



**-- \*\*Most challenging:\*\*** Working with the API task was the most challenging. I had to handle network errors, parse JSON responses correctly, and ensure the program didn’t crash if the data structure changed. Debugging and testing the API calls required careful attention.  



**-- \*\*Most interesting:\*\*** Writing Python code to solve problems and implement projects was the most interesting part. I enjoyed creating classes and objects, designing methods, and solving algorithm challenges. It gave me practical experience in applying Python concepts effectively and writing clean, organized, and reusable code.



**-- \*\*What I learned/improved:\*\*** I improved my skills in error handling, API integration, and working with JSON data. I also strengthened my ability to debug and write resilient code.
